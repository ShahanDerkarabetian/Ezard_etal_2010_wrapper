###################################################################

I have turned the Ezard et al. (2010) protocol into an executable wrapper script, which produces many useful output files and plots.
I take no responsibility for the creation of this method. I merely make it easier to implement for those less familiar with R.

As such, please cite: 
Ezard, T.H.G., P.N. Pearson, A. Purvis. 2010. Algorithmic approaches to aid speciesâ€™ delimitation in multidimensional morphospace. BMC Evolutionary Biology 10: 175.

Although if you use these scripts, an additional reference to my GitHub page is appreciated. You know, job search, broader impacts, and such.

There are two scripts: "Ezard_script_commandline.R" to be executed via Unix command line, and "Ezard_Script_R", the command for execution in R or Rstudio.



###################################################################
REQUIREMENTS:
###################################################################

The scripts has been tested and work on R versions 3.0-3.3. 
R 3.4 has an issue with a required package if run through command line, although it works with R 3.4.4 through RStudio.

Required R packages: "pcaPP", "mclust", "mvoutlier", "vegan", "gplots"
To install: install.packages("package_name")



###################################################################
INPUT FILES:
###################################################################

<data_file>:
A .csv file containing the morphometric dataset, where each row is a set of measurements for a single sample. 
Do not include row or column names. See example_data.csv.

<taxon_file>:
A .csv file with two columns: 
Column 1 - a priori taxon/group assignments corresponding to each row in the dataset.
Column 2 - sample voucher/names/numbers
It should contain the same number of rows as data_file. Do not include column names. See example_taxon.csv.



###################################################################
COMMANDLINE VERSION
###################################################################

Ezard_Script.R and the two input files should be in the same folder. 

The "Ezard_Script_commandline.R" file is executed via Unix command. cd to the folder and run: 
Rscript Ezard_Script_commandline.R <data_file> <taxon_file>

To run the example: 
Rscript Ezard_Script_commandline.R example_data.csv example_taxon.csv



###################################################################
SETTINGS/THRESHOLDS
###################################################################

Several settings are automatically set, but can be changed if necessary:
	k, automatically set to the number of characters in the dataset 
	scale, set to use the median absolute deviation (mad)
	center, uses the median
	method, uses the "qn" estimator
	qcrit, set to 0.975
If you want to change the k, scale, center and/or method settings see "pcaPP" R package instructions for options.



###################################################################
OUTPUT FILES:
###################################################################

All output files are written to the directory "Ezard_output".

retained_components.csv 	- retained principal components
BIC.csv				- BIC table
outliers.csv		- outlier identification, 0=outlier
groups.csv			- cluster assignments for each taxon
squared_eigenvalues.csv		- squared eigenvalues for all components
full_results.csv			- contains species, voucher, retained components, group assignments, and outlier status information for all samples
model_choice.txt		- resulting model choice
clusters.pdf			- principal component scatterplot of first two PCs, grouped by clusters
taxa.pdf			- principal component scatterplot of first two PCs, grouped by a priori taxon
samples.pdf			- scatterplot, labeled by voucher/sample name
taxa_key.pdf		- legend for taxa.pdf. a separate file so you can place it anywhere you want on taxa.pdf



###################################################################
NOTES/ISSUES
###################################################################

Note that the taxon_file names do not necessarily have to correspond to species. They can be population names, morphological groups, geographic groups, anything. 
The groupings play no role in the determination of clusters. This is included for output purposes, if you want to color code your resulting plot by some a priori or a posteriori grouping.
That said, the script does require at least two different values.



This method expects a complete dataset with no missing data. If you are missing values for some specimens, either the missing impute values, or consider removing the variable. 
Otherwise, it will give you this error:

In max(which(m1$sdev^2 > bstick(m1))) :
  no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf
Error in 1:nk : result would be too long a vector
Execution halted



To make this script more efficient, it only outputs plots for the first two Principal Components.
If more than 2 components are retained you will have to plot the other pairwise plots yourself.
If only one component is retained, the X-axis in the plot will be "samples". Beware of this.
If three components are retained, you can make a cool, rotatable 3D scatterplot with the rgl package:

require("rgl")
plot3d(x=c(pp[,2]), y=c(pp[,3]), z=c(pp[,4]), group=c(pp[,1]), type="p", col=group, xlab="Comp1", ylab="Comp2", zlab="Comp3", size=5, lwd=15, box=F)
M <- par3d("userMatrix")
play3d( par3dinterp( userMatrix=list(M,rotate3d(M, angle=pi, x=0 , y=1, z=0))), duration=1)



For more than 10 taxa/groups (column 1 in <taxon_file>), make sure all groups were given different colors in the taxa_key.pdf output file. If not, you can adjust the R color settings, or edit the pdf.



For some reason, this script also produces an empty file called Rplots.pdf. I don't know. Just delete it.
